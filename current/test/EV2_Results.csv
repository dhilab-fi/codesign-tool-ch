I have one doubt related to the cards: they were distributed among the participants in an aleatory -if I understood well- way. But what if there were solutions/ideas more convenient to some of the cards that were not used? Should we short them out or distributing them to the participants without previous selection is important to trigger their creativity? Lastly, I also found very useful that the storyboard at the end was organised in three stages. It helped us focus -considering also that it was the end of the design session and we were feeling more tired than at the begining- and also helped us organise better and structure the experience.

It really helps if you only have a vague idea about a design project and want to define it more clearly. On the other hand, I think the tool has these issues: some of the cards dealing with abstract concepts have too much overlap; the tool could be improved if it had a field dedicated to the cards chosen during each step, to help the coherence of the co-design session.
